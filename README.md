## Memory Leaks
Some common memory leaks that can be presented in any Android project. There
is a description, how to fix it, and one example in code.

## References in Java
I compare the three references in Java:
* Soft
* Weak
* Strong

## Garbage Collector
I will try to explain garbage collection in simple words. There are so many
articles and documents which are too complex to understand. So, this approach
is easy and straight to the point.

## Android Profiler vs DDMS
Some notes will be presented.

## Status
This document is: _in progress_

## Why?
These documents are made with the intention to give some basic
information about Android and java development common problems
or guidelines for junior programmers.
